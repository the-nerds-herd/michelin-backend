Servers are knowledgeable and warm; the room is conducive to conversations. This is a civilized affair for sophisticated patrons celebrating a special occasion.The restaurant may be over 40 years old, but Chef Patrick O’Connell’s cuisine shines as brightly as ever. Each menu has a unique focus: Here and Now spotlights seasonality; “Gastronaut” reflects the chef's ambitions; and “The Good Earth” offers superb vegetarian items. Guests can also meander through all three for a full sense of what this kitchen can do. Their extraordinary focus on detail and sourcing is clear from the start in the BLT-inspired amuse-bouche with heirloom tomato gelée, or the excellent rye bread smeared with honeycomb butter. Sauces work a particular magic, as seen in the truffle-infused tartar with morel “crabcake.”Desserts like coconut sorbet with ginger granité are perfection",

That said, they provide precious little information on how each evening’s single prix-fixe will unfold—there are no menus, and diners have a minimal glimpse of what is to come next. But relinquishing control to these capable chefs (and sommelier) is the only way to go, as the results are bound to leave you feeling uplifted.Meals begin with small bites that treat the palate to raw, cool and cooked flavors. These have included soft brioche topped with trout roe, sliced sea scallop crudo over a lobster reduction and sweet-savory warm Medjool dates filled with mascarpone and finished with a sprinkle of sea salt. From there, delve into a duo of wonderfully rustic house-made pastas, like ravioli filled with celery root and dressed with morels, favas and bits of lamb’s tongue. Roasted kid goat with fluffy pita conjures the best of Greece.",

Scoring a meal at said counter proves challenging since seats can only be booked online, via e-mail, 30 days in advance. Once secured, a reservation here grants entrée to a cloistered room where Chefs Nobu Yamazaki and Masaya Kitayama cater to a mere handful of diners.Following the construct of kaiseki, the meal is a series of artistically composed courses, such as grilled marinated tuna cheek or squid ink-tinted soft-shell crab tempura. The experience hits its apex come sushi time when the chefs present a stack of boxes stocked with an immense selection of fish arranged by type, and then invite diners to make selections from this bounty, which are then knifed into sashimi. An equally superb nigiri course follows, allowing further opportunity to delve deeper into the jaw-dropping assemblage.",

        "introduction": "With stone walls, seasonal arrangements, and Warhol-esque prints, this central DC powerhouse is equal parts retro glitz and country lodge. Before even crossing the threshold, diners are met with gracious and enthusiastic servers. While they may rhapsodize about their favorite dishes, take your time to peruse the pithy menu, complete with a sense of mystery, stunning ensembles, and playful twists.Classic and modern elements come together in the regional Italian food, which is as likely to celebrate Roman inspiration as it is to represent Venetian flavors. Products, partially sourced from Chancellors Rock farm in Rappahannock County, are sterling as seen in the cacio e pepe remix, which takes the form of risotto with nasturtium (in place of pepper), confit beets, and tomato coulis. Crabbing here involves cabbage-wrapped crabmeat with pappa al pomodoro and intense red prawn oil, all accompanied by polenta. Comfort is king in rigatoni alla carbonara with guanciale; while palate cleansers like yuzu granité make a smooth segue to Sicilian cassata—perhaps the most colorful dessert ever.",

A riff on cassoulet, for instance, features flageolet bean purée nestling a crispy pork jowl croquette and Santa Barbara uni. The crowning flourish is a zesty sorbet made from aji dulce peppers grown at the restaurant's garden in Virginia. The hearty boudin noir-stuffed quail breast; and 'tagliatelle' fashioned from celery root as well as Cognac- and foie gras-enriched jus are other delightful highlights.",

Its décor pays homage to the industrial bones of the setting by way of exposed brick and stark white walls, softened by greenery; fine service and an inviting open kitchen simply add to the appeal.Diners are offered myriad choices for their five-course meal, replete with consistently impressive dishes. Large appetites should put their faith in the chef and let him prepare a seven-course tasting, whereby sustainable ingredients are utilized to prepare items that are at once creative, astutely composed, and highly enjoyable. Dinner might kick off with lightly poached Chesapeake oysters, coupled with morels, ramps, and Madeira foam; or soy- and mirin-marinated tuna tartare spiked with lemon rind. Risi e bisi may then arrive, tucked with English peas, pancetta, and pecorino; while perfectly aged Wagyu ribeye, sprinkled with sea salt, is matched with truffle-mashed potatoes for ultimate decadence.Desserts, like a white chocolate buttermilk cake or raspberry lychee sorbet, display expert flavor combinations and will have you drooling for days.",
