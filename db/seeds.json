Servers are knowledgeable and warm; the room is conducive to conversations. This is a civilized affair for sophisticated patrons celebrating a special occasion.The restaurant may be over 40 years old, but Chef Patrick O’Connell’s cuisine shines as brightly as ever. Each menu has a unique focus: Here and Now spotlights seasonality; “Gastronaut” reflects the chef's ambitions; and “The Good Earth” offers superb vegetarian items. Guests can also meander through all three for a full sense of what this kitchen can do. Their extraordinary focus on detail and sourcing is clear from the start in the BLT-inspired amuse-bouche with heirloom tomato gelée, or the excellent rye bread smeared with honeycomb butter. Sauces work a particular magic, as seen in the truffle-infused tartar with morel “crabcake.”Desserts like coconut sorbet with ginger granité are perfection",

But relinquishing control to these capable chefs (and sommelier) is the only way to go, as the results are bound to leave you feeling uplifted.Meals begin with small bites that treat the palate to raw, cool and cooked flavors. These have included soft brioche topped with trout roe, sliced sea scallop crudo over a lobster reduction and sweet-savory warm Medjool dates filled with mascarpone and finished with a sprinkle of sea salt. From there, delve into a duo of wonderfully rustic house-made pastas, like ravioli filled with celery root and dressed with morels, favas and bits of lamb’s tongue. Roasted kid goat with fluffy pita conjures the best of Greece.",

Sushi Taro may offer a solid à la carte and numerous tasting menus, but the overall experience at the omakase counter is truly stellar. Scoring a meal at said counter proves challenging since seats can only be booked online, via e-mail, 30 days in advance. Once secured, a reservation here grants entrée to a cloistered room where Chefs Nobu Yamazaki and Masaya Kitayama cater to a mere handful of diners.Following the construct of kaiseki, the meal is a series of artistically composed courses, such as grilled marinated tuna cheek or squid ink-tinted soft-shell crab tempura. The experience hits its apex come sushi time when the chefs present a stack of boxes stocked with an immense selection of fish arranged by type, and then invite diners to make selections from this bounty, which are then knifed into sashimi. An equally superb nigiri course follows, allowing further opportunity to delve deeper into the jaw-dropping assemblage.",

Each course is presented like a revelation—the fish paired with perfectly sticky, short-grain rice, served just above room temperature. Think tender, bright orange spring salmon with a glossy streak of soy; firm Japanese cuttlefish, dotted with shiso leaf and plum sauce; as well as Golden Eye snapper, finished with a squeeze of lemon and sea salt.It will take you a couple of hours to work your way through the luxurious 20-course omakase of Chef Daisuke Nakazawa, who trained under the legendary Jiro Ono, but rest assured it is time well spent.",

Products, partially sourced from Chancellors Rock farm in Rappahannock County, are sterling as seen in the cacio e pepe remix, which takes the form of risotto with nasturtium (in place of pepper), confit beets, and tomato coulis. Crabbing here involves cabbage-wrapped crabmeat with pappa al pomodoro and intense red prawn oil, all accompanied by polenta. Comfort is king in rigatoni alla carbonara with guanciale; while palate cleansers like yuzu granité make a smooth segue to Sicilian cassata—perhaps the most colorful dessert ever.",

        "introduction": "Chef Matt Baker is luring diners to Ivy City with this gorgeous spot, which transforms local products into thoughtful, modern, and deeply complex plates. Its décor pays homage to the industrial bones of the setting by way of exposed brick and stark white walls, softened by greenery; fine service and an inviting open kitchen simply add to the appeal.Diners are offered myriad choices for their five-course meal, replete with consistently impressive dishes. Large appetites should put their faith in the chef and let him prepare a seven-course tasting, whereby sustainable ingredients are utilized to prepare items that are at once creative, astutely composed, and highly enjoyable. Dinner might kick off with lightly poached Chesapeake oysters, coupled with morels, ramps, and Madeira foam; or soy- and mirin-marinated tuna tartare spiked with lemon rind. Risi e bisi may then arrive, tucked with English peas, pancetta, and pecorino; while perfectly aged Wagyu ribeye, sprinkled with sea salt, is matched with truffle-mashed potatoes for ultimate decadence.Desserts, like a white chocolate buttermilk cake or raspberry lychee sorbet, display expert flavor combinations and will have you drooling for days.",

        "introduction": "What makes this gem such a memorable dining destination is that the cooking is ambitious yet whimsical, and completely devoid of formality or fuss. Whether the bartender or Chef de Cuisine Scott Muns serves you, no one in this kitchen seems self-important. Your continued enjoyment is paramount—an honorable feat considering that one is in for a meal that occupies most of the night. \nThe small space may be packed, but the ambience is pleasant and very comfortable. The prix-fixe menu includes beverage pairings, but guests seated at the bar may choose to order drinks à la carte as well. Regardless, dishes spark interest and the service remains at its highest level. Start with a pristine sea scallop from North Carolina, matched with diced kohlrabi for crunch, and dressed tableside with a lush brown butter sabayon. Then move on to monkfish en papillote delicately set atop creamy Carolina Gold rice.\nInvention is also a point of pride here, best seen in the baton of 'French toast' that combines foie gras, blue cheese, and black truffles to thrilling effect. Similarly, a perfect wedge of butternut squash-ice cream cake, with crème fraîche and pumpkin seeds, is divine in demeanor and flavor.",

Enter Rose’s Luxury and you’ll need to decide whether you’re heading upstairs for drinks or settling in for a meal at one of their many nooks. This dining room is all about fun, especially at the kitchen-facing counter. The décor is decidedly laid-back, with an array of bare wood tables and exposed bulbs that make you feel like you’re in someone’s backyard. This casual mood means you’ll spot all types inside, including couples with tots in tow. \nSample the kitchen's greatest work by way of its enticingly creative and astutely executed cooking. Pasta lovers will devour the dedicated list, revealing such offerings as 'Little Spindles' draped in a sauce made from puréed broccoli, enriched with aged Gouda, and embellished with a judicious bit of green chili. Salt and pepper catfish coupled with a caviar-crowned tartar sauce is as extravagant as a side of warm and crisp hush puppies.\nDesserts are often unexpected but assuredly stirring. Sample a wedge of the crème fraîche tart (à la Nancy Silverton's Campanile in LA). This decadent rendering joins the hit list, thanks to its puffy base, creamy and perfectly tart filling, and diced pineapple garnish.",

        "introduction": "From the team behind hit restaurants, Rose’s Luxury and Pineapple and Pearls, arrives this much-beloved 'little pearl.' Its youthful ambience and carriage house setting, which dates back to the Civil War, makes a nice contrast. Inside, it's charming and modern, featuring an atrium-like glass ceiling, pale yellow-painted walls, as well as a bright and expansive patio. By day, this is a sweet and sunny café; come nighttime, the wine begins to flow and the tiny tables overflow with dishes laid out like a hazy culinary dream.Chef Aaron Silverman’s cooking style turns classics on their head in the most inventive ways. To wit, his clever and delicious Angel Eggs highlights deviled egg dupes that employ savory meringue as faux egg whites and are piped with egg yolk comprised of mayonnaise and flakes of sea salt. Fancy tater tots then arrive as perfectly fried squares of golden potatoes, topped with a dot of cod roe hollandaise and chives; while marinated and grilled pineapple sambal-chicken wings delight both sweet and savory fiends.The tasting menu is a steal at $45 for eight courses; and the playfully eclectic wine list makes for a great read and is absolutely worth adding on a pairing.",

        "introduction": "With its seamless blend of indoor and outdoor spaces, Masseria is a shining beacon amidst the area's glossy high-rises, restaurants, and shopping galore. The former warehouse—complete with the requisite exposed ducts, brick walls, and classic farmhouse vibe—is glam yet austere with a stainless steel kitchen, chrome and leather furnishings, pendant lights suspended from nautical rope and an impressive glass-encased wine cellar.\nIt’s all very relaxed albeit in a well-dressed way, and the feel-good aura extends to the staff, who clearly like working here as much as diners enjoy lingering over their meals.Chef/owner Nicholas Stefanelli's Puglian heritage comes through in the menu, which features four or five courses, along with a nightly tasting. The kitchen hits all the right notes balancing trendy and serious. Begin with a cigar box filled with focaccia so sinfully delicious, you’ll be tempted to scarf it all down—but don’t. You’ll want to save room for the spicy fish stew, a thing of beauty practically brimming with tripe and lobster, or house-made maccheroni with a thick and gamey goat ragù. Even dessert strays far from the pack, showcasing beet ice cream instead of the classic tiramisu.",
